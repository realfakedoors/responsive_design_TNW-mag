# responsive_design_TNW-mag
An exercise in responsive design and media queries, based on The Next Web's home page:  
https://thenextweb.com/  

The page's layout changes significantly at 1024px, and again at 768px. We can achieve this effect with media queries based on viewport width, for a nice responsive design. This allows users of all screen sizes to enjoy our site!
